          Clarified interactions between bacterial community structures in the neonatal gut microbiome to investigate a possible etiology for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This was accomplished by generating bacterial co-occurrence networks by analyzing 16S rRNA sequencing data from more than 300 preterm infants.
